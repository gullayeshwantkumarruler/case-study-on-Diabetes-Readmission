# case-study-on-Diabetes-Readmission
In USA 1 person in every 10 is suffering from diabetes and is getting admitted in the hospital. So there is a chance that some people may be in an certain need of being readmitted in the hospital due to diabetes and there may be less necessity for some others so Now here I am trying to predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.
So In this project we will check to confirm the readmission of patients in the hospital due to diabetes.
